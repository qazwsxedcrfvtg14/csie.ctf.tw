Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book  called True Stories from Nature  about the primeval forest  It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal  Here is a copy of the drawingIn the book it said   Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole  without chewing it  After that they are not able to move  and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestionI pondered deeply  then  over the adventures of the jungle  And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing  My Drawing Number One  It looked like thisI showed my masterpiece to the grown ups  and asked them whether the drawing frightened themBut they answered   Frighten  Why should any one be frightened by a hatMy drawing was not a picture of a hat  It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant  But since the grown ups were not able to understand it  I made another drawing  I drew the inside of the boa constrictor  so that the grown ups could see it clearly  They always need to have things explained  My Drawing Number Two looked like thisThe grown ups  response  this time  was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors  whether from the inside or the outside  and devote myself instead to geography  history  arithmetic and grammar  That is why  at the age of six  I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter  I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two  Grown ups never understand anything by themselves  and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to themSo then I chose another profession  and learned to pilot airplanes  I have flown a little over all parts of the world  and it is true that geography has been very useful to me  At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona  If one gets lost in the night  such knowledge is valuableIn the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence  I have lived a great deal among grown ups  I have seen them intimately  close at hand  And that hasn t much improved my opinion of themWhenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear sighted  I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One  which I have always kept  I would try to find out  so  if this was a person of true understanding  But  whoever it was  he  or she  would always sayThat is a hatThen I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors  or primeval forests  or stars  I would bring myself down to his level  I would talk to him about bridge  and golf  and politics  and neckties  And the grown up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible manSo I lived my life alone  without anyone that I could really talk to  until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara  six years ago  Something was broken in my engine  And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers  I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone  It was a question of life or death for me  I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a weekThe first night  then  I went to sleep on the sand  a thousand miles from any human habitation  I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean  Thus you can imagine my amazement  at sunrise  when I was awakened by an odd little voice  It saidIf you please   draw me a sheepWhatDraw me a sheepI jumped to my feet  completely thunderstruck  I blinked my eyes hard  I looked carefully all around me  And I saw a most extraordinary small person  who stood there examining me with great seriousness  Here you may see the best potrait that  later  I was able to make of him  But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its modelThat  however  is not my fault  The grown ups discouraged me in my painter s career when I was six years old  and I never learned to draw anything  except boas from the outside and boas from the insideNow I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment  Remember  I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region  And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands  nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear  Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert  a thousand miles from any human habitation  When at last I was able to speak  I said to himBut   what are you doing hereAnd in answer he repeated  very slowly  as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequenceIf you please   draw me a sheepWhen a mystery is too overpowering  one dare not disobey  Absurd as it might seem to me  a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death  I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain pen  But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography  history  arithmetic  and grammar  and I told the little chap  a little crossly  too  that I did not know how to draw  He answered meThat doesn t matter  Draw me a sheepBut I had never drawn a sheep  So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often  It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside  And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it withNo  no  no  I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor  A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature  and an elephant is very cumbersome  Where I live  everything is very small  What I need is a sheep  Draw me a sheepSo then I made a drawingHe looked at it carefully  then he saidNo  This sheep is already very sickly  Make me anotherSo I made another drawingMy friend smiled gently and indulgentyYou see yourself   he said   that this is not a sheep  This is a ram  It has hornsSo then I did my drawing over once moreBut it was rejected too  just like the othersThis one is too old  I want a sheep that will live a long timeBy this time my patience was exhausted  because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart  So I tossed off this drawingAnd I threw out an explanation with itThis is only his box  The sheep you asked for is insideI was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judgeThat is exactly the way I wanted it  Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grassWhyBecause where I live everything is very smallThere will surely be enough grass for him   I said   It is a very small sheep that I have given youHe bent his head over the drawingNot so small that   Look  He has gone to sleepAnd that is how I made the acquaintance of the little princeIt took me a long time to learn where he came from  The little prince  who asked me so many questions  never seemed to hear the ones I asked him  It was from words dropped by chance that  little by little  everything was revealed to meThe first time he saw my airplane  for instance  I shall not draw my airplane  that would be much too complicated for me   he asked meWhat is that objectThat is not an object  It flies  It is an airplane  It is my airplaneAnd I was proud to have him learn that I could flyHe cried out  thenWhat  You dropped down from the skyOh  That is funnyAnd the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter  which irritated me very much  I like my misfortunes to be taken seriouslyThen he addedSo you  too  come from the sky  Which is your planetAt that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence  and I demanded  abruptlyDo you come from another planetBut he did not reply  He tossed his head gently  without taking his eyes from my planeIt is true that on that you can t have come from very far awayAnd he sank into a reverie  which lasted a long time  Then  taking my sheep out of his pocket  he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasureYou can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half confidence about the  other planets   I made a great effort  therefore  to find out more on this subjectMy little man  where do you come from  What is this  where I live   of which you speak  Where do you want to take your sheepAfter a reflective silence he answeredThe thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his houseThat is so  And if you are good I will give you a string  too  so that you can tie him during the day  and a post to tie him toBut the little prince seemed shocked by this offerTie him  What a queer ideaBut if you don t tie him   I said   he will wander off somewhere  and get lostMy friend broke into another peal of laughterBut where do you think he would goAnywhere  Straight ahead of himThen the little prince said  earnestlyThat doesn t matter  Where I live  everything is so smallAnd  with perhaps a hint of sadness  he addedStraight ahead of him  nobody can go very farI had thus learned a second fact of great importance  this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a houseBut that did not really surprise me much  I knew very well that in addition to the great planets   such as the Earth  Jupiter  Mars  Venus   to which we have given names  there are also hundreds of others  some of which are so small that one has a hard t ime seeing them through the telescope  When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name  but only a number  He might call it  for example   Asteroid 325I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B 612This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope  That was by a Turkish astronomer  in 1909On making his discovery  the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress  in a great demonstration  But he was in Turkish costume  and so nobody would believe what he saidGrown ups are like thatFortunately  however  for the reputation of Asteroid B 612  a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects  under pain of death  should change to European costume  So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again  dressed with impressive style and elegance  And this time everybody accepted his reportIf I have told you these details about the asteroid  and made a note of its number for you  it is on account of the grown ups and their ways  When you tell them that you have made a new friend  they never ask you any questions about essential matters  T hey never say to you   What does his voice sound like  What games does he love best  Does he collect butterflies   Instead  they demand   How old is he  How many brothers has he  How much does he weigh  How much money does his father make   Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about himIf you were to say to the grown ups   I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick  with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof   they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all  You would have to say to them   I saw a house that cost   20 000   Then they would exclaim   Oh  what a pretty house that isJust so  you might say to them   The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming  that he laughed  and that he was looking for a sheep  If anybody wants a sheep  that is a proof that he exists   And what good would it do to tell them th at  They would shrug their shoulders  and treat you like a child  But if you said to them   The planet he came from is Asteroid B 612   then they would be convinced  and leave you in peace from their questionsThey are like that  One must not hold it against them  Children should always show great forbearance toward grown up peopleBut certainly  for us who understand life  figures are a matter of indifference  I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy tales  I should have like to say   Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself  and who had need of a sheepTo those who understand life  that would have given a much greater air of truth to my storyFor I do not want any one to read my book carelessly  I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories  Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me  with his sheep  If I try to describe him here  it is to make sure that I shall not forget him  To forget a friend is sad  Not every one has had a friend  And if I forget him  I may become like the grown ups who are no longer interested in anything but figuresIt is for that purpose  again  that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils  It is hard to take up drawing again at my age  when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the i nside  since I was six  I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible  But I am not at all sure of success  One drawing goes along all right  and another has no resemblance to its subject  I make some errors  too  in the littl e prince s height  in one place he is too tall and in another too short  And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume  So I fumble along as best I can  now good  now bad  and I hope generally fair to middlingIn certain more important details I shall make mistakes  also  But that is something that will not be my fault  My friend never explained anything to me  He thought  perhaps  that I was like himself  But I  alas  do not know how to see sheep through t he walls of boxes  Perhaps I am a little like the grown ups  I have had to grow oldAs each day passed I would learn  in our talk  something about the little prince s planet  his departure from it  his journey  The information would come very slowly  as it might chance to fall from his thoughts  It was in this way that I heard  on the third day  about the catastrophe of the baobabsThis time  once more  I had the sheep to thank for it  For the little prince asked me abruptly   as if seized by a grave doubt    It is true  isn t it  that sheep eat little bushesYes  that is trueAh  I am gladI did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes  But the little prince addedThen it follows that they also eat baobabsI pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes  but  on the contrary  trees as big as castles  and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him  the herd would not eat up one single baobabThe idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laughWe would have to put them one on top of the other   he saidBut he made a wise commentBefore they grow so big  the baobabs start out by being littleThat is strictly correct   I said   But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabsHe answered me at once   Oh  come  come    as if he were speaking of something that was self evident  And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem  without any assistanceIndeed  as I learned  there were on the planet where the little prince lived   as on all planets   good plants and bad plants  In consequence  there were good seeds from good plants  and bad seeds from bad plants  But seeds are invisible  They sleep deep in the heart of the earth s darkness  until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken  Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin   timidly at first   to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun  If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose bush  one would let it grow wherever it might wish  But when it is a bad plant  one must destroy it as soon as possible  the very first instant that one recognizes itNow there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince  and these were the seeds of the baobab  The soil of that planet was infested with them  A baobab is something you will never  never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late  It spreads over the entire planet  It bores clear through it with its roots  And if the planet is too small  and the baobabs are too many  they split it in piecesIt is a question of discipline   the little prince said to me later on   When you ve finished your own toilet in the morning  then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet  just so  with the greatest care  You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs  at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth  It is very tedious work   the little prince added   but very easyAnd one day he said to me   You ought to make a beautiful drawing  so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is  That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day  Sometimes   he added   there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day  But when it is a matter of baobabs  that always means a catastrophe  I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man  He neglected three little bushesSo  as the little prince described it to me  I have made a drawing of that planet  I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist  But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood  and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid  that for once I am breaking through my reserve   Children   I say plainly   watch out for the baobabsMy friends  like myself  have been skirting this danger for a long time  without ever knowing it  and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing  The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost mePerhaps you will ask me   Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabsThe reply is simple  I have tried  But with the others I have not been successful  When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessityOh  little prince  Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life    For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset  I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day  w hen you said to meI am very fond of sunsets  Come  let us go look at a sunset nowBut we must wait   I saidWait  For whatFor the sunset  We must wait until it is timeAt first you seemed to be very much surprised  And then you laughed to yourself  You said to meI am always thinking that I am at homeJust so  Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over FranceIf you could fly to France in one minute  you could go straight into the sunset  right from noon  Unfortunately  France is too far away for that  But on your tiny planet  my little prince  all you need do is move your chair a few steps  You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you likeOne day   you said to me   I saw the sunset forty four timesAnd a little later you addedYou know   one loves the sunset  when one is so sadWere you so sad  then   I asked   on the day of the forty four sunsetsBut the little prince made no replyOn the fifth day   again  as always  it was thanks to the sheep   the secret of the little prince s life was revealed to me  Abruptly  without anything to lead up to it  and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem  he demandedA sheep   if it eats little bushes  does it eat flowers  tooA sheep   I answered   eats anything it finds in its reachEven flowers that have thornsYes  even flowers that have thornsThen the thorns   what use are theyI did not know  At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine  I was very much worried  for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious  And I had so little drinking water left that I had to fear for the worstThe thorns   what use are theyThe little prince never let go of a question  once he had asked it  As for me  I was upset over that bolt  And I answered with the first thing that came into my headThe thorns are of no use at all  Flowers have thorns just for spiteOhThere was a moment of complete silence  Then the little prince flashed back at me  with a kind of resentfulnessI don t believe you  Flowers are weak creatures  They are naive  They reassure themselves as best they can  They believe that their thorns are terrible weaponsI did not answer  At that instant I was saying to myself   If this bolt still won t turn  I am going to knock it out with the hammer   Again the little prince disturbed my thoughtsAnd you actually believe that the flowersOh  no   I cried   No  no no  I don t believe anything  I answered you with the first thing that came into my head  Don t you see   I am very busy with matters of consequenceHe stared at me  thunderstruckMatters of consequenceHe looked at me there  with my hammer in my hand  my fingers black with engine grease  bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely uglyYou talk just like the grown upsThat made me a little ashamed  But he went on  relentlesslyYou mix everything up together    You confuse everythingHe was really very angry  He tossed his golden curls in the breezeI know a planet where there is a certain red faced gentleman  He has never smelled a flower  He has never looked at a star  He has never loved any one  He has never done anything in his life but add up figures  And all day he says over and over  just like you   I am busy with matters of consequence   And that makes him swell up with pride  But he is not a man   he is a mushroomA whatA mushroomThe little prince was now white with rageThe flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years  For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same  And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them  Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important  Is this not of more consequence than a fat red faced gentleman s sums  And if I know   I  myself   one flower which is unique in the world  which grows nowhere but on my planet  but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning  without even noticing what he is doing   Oh  You think that is not importantHis face turned from white to red as he continuedIf some one loves a flower  of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars  it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars  He can say to himself   Somewhere  my flower is there     But if the sheep eats the flower  in one moment all his stars will be darkened    And you think that is not importantHe could not say anything more  His words were choked by sobbingThe night had fallen  I had let my tools drop from my hands  Of what moment now was my hammer  my bolt  or thirst  or death  On one star  one planet  my planet  the Earth  there was a little prince to be comforted  I took him in my arms  and rocked him  I said to himThe flower that you love is not in danger  I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep  I will draw you a railing to put around your flower  I willI did not know what to say to him  I felt awkward and blundering  I did not know how I could reach him  where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once moreIt is such a secret place  the land of tearsI soon learned to know this flower better  On the little prince s planet the flowers had always been very simple  They had only one ring of petals  they took up no room at all  they were a trouble to nobody  One morning they would appear in the grass  and by night they would have faded peacefully away  But one day  from a seed blown from no one knew where  a new flower had come up  and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet  It might  you see  have been a new kind of baobabThe shrub soon stopped growing  and began to get ready to produce a flower  The little prince  who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud  felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it  But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber  She chose her colours with the greatest care  She adjusted her petals one by one  She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled  like the field poppies  It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear  Oh  yes  She was a coquettish creature  And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and daysThen one morning  exactly at sunrise  she suddenly showed herselfAnd  after working with all this painstaking precision  she yawned and saidAh  I am scarcely awake  I beg that you will excuse me  My petals are still all disarrangedBut the little prince could not restrain his admirationOh  How beautiful you areAm I not   the flower responded  sweetly   And I was born at the same moment as the sunThe little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest   but how moving   and exciting   she wasI think it is time for breakfast   she added an instant later   If you would have the kindness to think of my needsAnd the little prince  completely abashed  went to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water  So  he tended the flowerSo  too  she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity   which was  if the truth be known  a little difficult to deal with  One day  for instance  when she was speaking of her four thorns  she said to the little princeLet the tigers come with their clawsThere are no tigers on my planet   the little prince objected   And  anyway  tigers do not eat weedsI am not a weed   the flower replied  sweetlyPlease excuse meI am not at all afraid of tigers   she went on   but I have a horror of drafts  I suppose you wouldn t have a screen for meA horror of drafts   that is bad luck  for a plant   remarked the little prince  and added to himself   This flower is a very complex creatureAt night I want you to put me under a glass globe  It is very cold where you live  In the place I came fromBut she interrupted herself at that point  She had come in the form of a seed  She could not have known anything of any other worlds  Embarassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naive untruth  she coughed two or three times  in order to put the little prince in the wrongThe screenI was just going to look for it when you spoke to meThen she forced her cough a little more so that he shoud suffer from remorse just the sameSo the little prince  in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love  had soon come to doubt her  He had taken seriously words which were without importance  and it made him very unhappyI ought not to have listened to her   he confided to me one day   One never ought to listen to the flowers  One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance  Mine perfumed all my planet  But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace  This tale of claws  which disturbed me so much  should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pityAnd he continued his confidencesThe fact is that I did not know how to understand anything  I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words  She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me  I ought never to have run away from her    I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems  Flowers are so inconsistent  But I was too young to know how to love herI believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds  On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order  He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes  He possessed two active volcanoes  and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning  He also had one volcano that was extinct  But  as he said   One never knows   So he cleaned out the extinct volcano  too  If they are well cleaned out  volcanoes burn slowly and steadily  without any eruptions  Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimneyOn our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes  That is why they bring no end of trouble upon usThe little prince also pulled up  with a certain sense of dejection  the last little shoots of the baobabs  He believed that he would never want to return  But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him  And when he watered the flower for the last time  and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe  he realised that he was very close to tearsGoodbye   he said to the flowerBut she made no answerGoodbye   he said againThe flower coughed  But it was not because she had a coldI have been silly   she said to him  at last   I ask your forgiveness  Try to be happyHe was surprised by this absence of reproaches  He stood there all bewildered  the glass globe held arrested in mid air  He did not understand this quiet sweetnessOf course I love you   the flower said to him   It is my fault that you have not known it all the while  That is of no importance  But you   you have been just as foolish as I  Try to be happy    let the glass globe be  I don t want it any moreBut the windMy cold is not so bad as all that    the cool night air will do me good  I am a flowerBut the animals FLAG{7h3_m4ny_T1m3_p4d_I5_r3411y_D4n9er0u5}Well  I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies  It seems that they are very beautiful  And if not the butterflies   and the caterpillars   who will call upon me  You will be far away    as for the large animals   I am not at all afraid of any of them  I have my clawsAnd  naively  she showed her four thorns  Then she addedDon t linger like this  You have decided to go away  Now goFor she did not want him to see her crying  She was such a proud flowerHe found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325  326  327  328  329  and 330  He began  therefore  by visiting them  in order to add to his knowledgeThe first of them was inhabited by a king  Clad in royal purple and ermine  he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majesticAh  Here is a subject   exclaimed the king  when he saw the little prince comingAnd the little prince asked himselfHow could he recognize me when he had never seen me beforeHe did not know how the world is simplified for kings  To them  all men are subjectsApproach  so that I may see you better   said the king  who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebodyThe little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down  but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king s magnificent ermine robe  So he remained standing upright  and  since he was tired  he yawnedIt is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king   the monarch said to him   I forbid you to do soI can t help it  I can t stop myself   replied the little prince  thoroughly embarrassed   I have come on a long journey  and I have had no sleepAh  then   the king said   I order you to yawn  It is years since I have seen anyone yawning  Yawns  to me  are objects of curiosity  Come  now  Yawn again  It is an orderThat frightens me    I cannot  any more     murmured the little prince  now completely abashedHum  Hum   replied the king   Then I   I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes toHe sputtered a little  and seemed vexedFor what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected  He tolerated no disobedience  He was an absolute monarch  But  because he was a very good man  he made his orders reasonableIf I ordered a general   he would say  by way of example   if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird  and if the general did not obey me  that would not be the fault of the general  It would be my faultMay I sit down   came now a timid inquiry from the little princeI order you to do so   the king answered him  and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantleBut the little prince was wondering    The planet was tiny  Over what could this king really ruleSire   he said to him   I beg that you will excuse my asking you a questionI order you to ask me a question   the king hastened to assure himSire   over what do you ruleOver everything   said the king  with magnificent simplicityOver everythingThe king made a gesture  which took in his planet  the other planets  and all the starsOver all that   asked the little princeOver all that   the king answeredFor his rule was not only absolute  it was also universalAnd the stars obey youCertainly they do   the king said   They obey instantly  I do not permit insubordinationSuch power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at  If he had been master of such complete authority  he would have been able to watch the sunset  not forty four times in one day  but seventy two  or even a hundred  or even two hundred times  without ever having to move his chair  And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken  he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favorI should like to see a sunset    do me that kindness    Order the sun to setIf I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly  or to write a tragic drama  or to change himself into a sea bird  and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received  which one of us would be in the wrong   the king demanded   The general  or myselfYou   said the little prince firmlyExactly  One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform   the king went on   Accepted authority rests first of all on reason  If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea  they would rise up in revolution  I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonableThen my sunset   the little prince reminded him  for he never forgot a question once he had asked itYou shall have your sunset  I shall command it  But  according to my science of government  I shall wait until conditions are favorableWhen will that be   inquired the little princeHum  Hum   replied the king  and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac   Hum  Hum  That will be about   about   that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight  And you will see how well I am obeyedThe little prince yawned  He was regretting his lost sunset  And then  too  he was already beginning to be a little boredI have nothing more to do here   he said to the king   So I shall set out on my way againDo not go   said the king  who was very proud of having a subject   Do not go  I will make you a MinisterMinister of whatMinster of   of JusticeBut there is nobody here to judgeWe do not know that   the king said to him   I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom  I am very old  There is no room here for a carriage  And it tires me to walkOh  but I have looked already   said the little prince  turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet  On that side  as on this  there was nobody at allThen you shall judge yourself   the king answered   that is the most difficult thing of all  It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others  If you succeed in judging yourself rightly  then you are indeed a man of true wisdomYes   said the little prince   but I can judge myself anywhere  I do not need to live on this planetHum  Hum   said the king   I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat  I hear him at night  You can judge this old rat  From time to time you will condemn him to death  Thus his life will depend on your justice  But you will pardon him on each occasion  for he must be treated thriftily  He is the only one we haveI   replied the little prince   do not like to condemn anyone to death  And now I think I will go on my wayNo   said the kingBut the little prince  having now completed his preparations for departure  had no wish to grieve the old monarchIf Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed   he said   he should be able to give me a reasonable order  He should be able  for example  to order me to be gone by the end of one minute  It seems to me that conditions are favorableAs thte king made no answer  the little prince hesitated a moment  Then  with a sigh  he took his leaveI made you my Ambassador   the king called out  hastilyHe had a magnificent air of authorityThe grown ups are very strange   the little prince said to himself  as he continued on his journeyThe second planet was inhabited by a conceited manAh  Ah  I am about to receive a visit from an admirer   he exclaimed from afar  when he first saw the little prince comingFor  to conceited men  all other men are admirersGood morning   said the little prince   That is a queer hat you are wearingIt is a hat for salutes   the conceited man replied   It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me  Unfortunately  nobody at all ever passes this wayYes   said the little prince  who did not understand what the conceited man was talking aboutClap your hands  one against the other   the conceited man now directed himThe little prince clapped his hands  The conceited man raised his hat in a modest saluteThis is more entertaining than the visit to the king   the little prince said to himself  And he began again to clap his hands  one against the other  The conceited man against raised his hat in saluteAfter five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game s monotonyAnd what should one do to make the hat come down   he askedBut the conceited man did not hear him  Conceited people never hear anything but praiseDo you really admire me very much   he demanded of the little princeWhat does that mean    admireTo admire mean that you regard me as the handsomest  the best dressed  the richest  and the most intelligent man on this planetBut you are the only man on your planetDo me this kindness  Admire me just the sameI admire you   said the little prince  shrugging his shoulders slightly   but what is there in that to interest you so muchAnd the little prince went awayThe grown ups are certainly very odd   he said to himself  as he continued on his journeyThe next planet was inhabited by a tippler  This was a very short visit  but it plunged the little prince into deep dejectionWhat are you doing there   he said to the tippler  whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottlesI am drinking   replied the tippler  with a lugubrious airWhy are you drinking   demanded the little princeSo that I may forget   replied the tipplerForget what   inquired the little prince  who already was sorry for himForget that I am ashamed   the tippler confessed  hanging his headAshamed of what   insisted the little prince  who wanted to help himAshamed of drinking   The tipler brought his speech to an end  and shut himself up in an impregnable silenceAnd the little prince went away  puzzledThe grown ups are certainly very  very odd   he said to himself  as he continued on his journeyThe fourth planet belonged to a businessman  This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince s arrivalGood morning   the little prince said to him   Your cigarette has gone outThree and two make five  Five and seven make twelve  Twelve and three make fifteen  Good morning  FIfteen and seven make twenty two  Twenty two and six make twenty eight  I haven t time to light it again  Twenty six and five make thirty one  Phew   Then that makes five hundred and one million  six hundred twenty two thousand  seven hundred thirty oneFive hundred million what   asked the little princeEh  Are you still there  Five hundred and one million   I can t stop    I have so much to do  I am concerned with matters of consequence  I don t amuse myself with balderdash  Two and five make sevenFive hundred and one million what   repeated the little prince  who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked itThe businessman raised his headDuring the fifty four years that I have inhabited this planet  I have been disturbed only three times  The first time was twenty two years ago  when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where  He made the most frightful noise that resounded all ov er the place  and I made four mistakes in my addition  The second time  eleven years ago  I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism  I don t get enough exercise  I have no time for loafing  The third time   well  this is it  I was saying  then  five  hundred and one millionsMillions of whatThe businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this questionMillions of those little objects   he said   which one sometimes sees in the skyFliesOh  no  Little glittering objectsBeesOh  no  Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming  As for me  I am concerned with matters of consequence  There is no time for idle dreaming in my lifeAh  You mean the starsf/`;åﬁÅû≈ü-Ä
